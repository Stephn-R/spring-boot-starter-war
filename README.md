## Modules

There are a number of modules being used with this project

**spring-boot-starters**

Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors. You get a one-stop-shop for all the Spring and related technology that you need without having to hunt through sample code and copy paste loads of dependency descriptors. For this project, we use the Web, Log4j2, Actuator, and Test starters

**gretty**

Gretty is a feature-rich gradle plugin for running web-apps on embedded servlet containers. It supports Jetty versions 7, 8 and 9, Tomcat versions 7 and 8, multiple web-apps and many more. It wraps servlet container functions as convenient Gradle tasks and configuration DSL.
